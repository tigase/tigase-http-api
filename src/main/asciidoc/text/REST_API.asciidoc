Tigase's HTTP API component uses the REST module and Groovy scripts responsible for handling and processing incoming HTTP.  The end result is Tigase's REST API.
This API may be useful for various integration scenarios.

In these sections we will describe the basic REST endpoints provided by Tigase HTTP API and explain the basics of creating new custom endpoints.

Other endpoints, specific to particular Tigase XMPP Server modules, are described in documentation for the modules providing them.
You may also look at `http://localhost:8080/rest/` on your local Tigase XMPP Server installation at HTTP API, which will provide you with basic usage examples for REST endpoints available at your installation.

For more informations about configuration of REST module please see section about <<REST module>>.
